# Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn**â€”whether a customer is likely to leave a service.  
It uses **machine learning classification techniques** and is trained on real-world customer data.

By identifying customers at risk of churn, businesses can implement **proactive retention strategies** to improve loyalty and reduce revenue loss.

## Features
- Clean and preprocess customer data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Build machine learning models with **Scikit-learn**  
- Achieved **98% accuracy** in predicting customer churn  
- Identify **high-risk customers** for targeted retention campaigns  
- Modular code for retraining models with new datasets

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data preprocessing & analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
